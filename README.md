### Project title

StoopIt

### What and why?

What is "stooping"? Essentially, stooping is a modern form of "one person's trash is another's treasure." Stooping is the act of picking up items off thrown out by others on the street before they are taken by a garbage truck. Stooping is a commonly seen phenomenon in New York City, where large items such as furniture or appliances are left outside on the curb on garbage day. When people find the object and pick it up, they have "stooped" it.

Many people in NYC stoop furniture as it is a sustainable and affordable way to furnish your home. One of the most popular accounts for stooping is [@stoopingnyc](https://www.instagram.com/stoopingnyc) on Instagram. With over 470K followers, this account posts potential "stoops" (items on the street that people might want) for others to pick up and take home.

The problem with [@stoopingnyc](https://www.instagram.com/stoopingnyc) is that they rely on users to submit stoops that they have found, and they accept stoops from all over NYC. Coupled with hundreds of thousands of followers, this results in stoops being posted to the page hours after they were initially found and submitted. Furthermore, the stoops are guaranteed to be very far from most people's locations due to how many followers there are all over NYC. This causes a feeling of missing out for users who are too far away or don't have the means to retrieve the furniture of their dreams. Or people rushing to stoop an item, only to arrive and see it has been taken since it was initially submitted hours ago. As a result, many location-specific stooping social media accounts have been made, such as [@stoopingbrooklyn](https://instagram.com/stoopinginbrooklyn), [@stoopinginqueens](https://www.instagram.com/stoopinginqueens), [@stoopingdowntown](https://www.instagram.com/stoopingdowntown), and many more for different areas of NYC.

We want to build StoopIt, a web app for stooping. Users will snap a picture of a potential stoop on their phone and upload it to the app, describing the type of item and its location. Once uploaded, other users using the app in the area will see the stoop in real-time and be able to grab it while it's still available. The homepage will consist of a scrolling feed of stoops, and users can filter their stoop feed; for example, only showing chairs within a 1-mile radius of their current location.

Stooping itself is important to continue as it promotes sustainability and saves people money. We shouldn't have to buy an entirely new dresser if there is a perfectly good one that someone doesn't want. StoopIt will be useful as it removes the issues with current stooping social media accounts with user submissions and admins. StoopIt will give users a better experience finding the perfect stoops by utilizing real-time location data and filtering. It also has the potential of growing and spreading to other cities as the data is location-based and not managed by an account.

### For whom?

Who will this software be for? These people are your end-users or customers.

Do not make software for imaginary users who do not exist - you must have real people as your initial end-users. Tell us who they are. For example, is it for a particular type of business, mass consumer, a campus office, a professor, or friends or family, or ... people just like you.

Understanding who your end-users are, and ideally speaking with some along the way, will help you refine your designs to be suitable for your audience, and understand whether you have succeeded at the end or not.

### How?

A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

### Scope

A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.
